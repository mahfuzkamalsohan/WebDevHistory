web 1.0: 
During the early days of web, web pages were static with no interactivity and limited design capabilities.
Each requests required full page reload. Pages contained mostly text and images using HTML for structure, 
and maybe some CSS for limited styling. The use of JavaScript for dynamic updates was still in its early stage.



web 2.0: 
Within a decade of its debut, web was revolutionized with user interactivity. Usage of templates offered
consistent design across web pages. Storage, retrieval and manipulation of data using databases familiarized
the concept of Backend development. As a result, frameworks like Django for Python, Laravel for PHP, started
to gain popularity. Backend Development involves managing databases, either using SQL 
(like MySQL and PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (like MongoDB and CouchDB). Although pages still required a reload for
each action, introduction to AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allowed partial updates to a page
without a full reload.


web 3.0:
The 2010s saw a surge in the popularity of frontend frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Angular,
enabling component-based development. Blockchain technology emerged as a cornerstone for decentralization
ensuring data security and privacy, and AI integration enhanced user interactions with effective responses.
This era also marked rise of Single Page Applications(SPAs) which dont require full page reloads.
